<h3>2. ExpressVPN</h3>
   <p>We recently <b>tested the top VPNs to find the fastest.</b> ExpressVPN came out above all.</p>

</p>
<p >ExpressVPN has an impressive <b> 3,000+ servers in 160 locations around the world.</b>
    These include 28 locations in the US, 6 in Australia, 5 in Canada, 5 in the Netherlands,

<p>I was also able to use ExpressVPN to unblock all the other streaming services I tested, including Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.</p>
<p>ExpressVPN is compatible with: Windows, Android, macOS, iOS, Linux, routers, Chromebook, Kindle Fire, Nook, Chrome, Firefox, games consoles, and Smart TVs
    </p>
<p>ExpressVPN guarantees your privacy and anonymity with several world-class security features. Military-grade encryption meets a kill switch and both DNS and IPv6 leak protection to prevent exposure of your IP address.</p>
   <p> Its server centers also use TrustedServer technology to wipe all servers every time they power off. Add on a strict no-logs policy and you can be sure ExpressVPN never logs or passes on your data.
